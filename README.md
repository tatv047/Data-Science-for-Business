## 1. Employee Retention Prediction

Hiring and retaining employees are extremely complex tasks that require capital,time and skills. Small business owners spend 40% of their working hours on tasks that don't generate any income such as hiring. Companies spend 15%-20% of the employee's salary to recruit a new candidate. An average company loses anywhere between 1% & 2.5% of their total revenue on the time it takes to bring a new hire upto speed. Hiring a new employee costs an average of $7650(0-500 corporation). It takes 52 days on average to fill a position. [(src)](https://toggl.com/blog/cost-of-hiring-an-employee) <br>
