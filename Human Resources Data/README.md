# HR Analytics: Employee Attrition Prediction

This project uses an HR dataset to predict **employee attrition** (i.e., whether an employee is likely to leave the company). The dataset includes a wide range of employee-related features such as demographics, job satisfaction, salary, performance, and work-life balance metrics.

## üéØ Objective

To build a machine learning model that can predict whether an employee will leave the company (`Attrition = 1`) based on the available features.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Potential Use Cases

- Employee retention analysis.
- Predictive workforce planning.
- Targeted engagement and satisfaction programs.

---

## üìå Notes

- Some features such as `Employee Count`, `Standard Hours`, and `Over 18` might be constant and can be removed during preprocessing.
- Categorical variables are encoded numerically and may need one-hot encoding or label decoding during exploration.
